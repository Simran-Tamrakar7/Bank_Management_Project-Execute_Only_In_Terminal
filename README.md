Description:
This is a Bank Management System project developed in Python that runs entirely in the terminal/command line interface. The project allows users to simulate core banking operations such as creating accounts, managing balances, depositing and withdrawing money, and viewing account details.

The system is designed to be simple, lightweight, and executed directly from the terminal, making it ideal for learning Python file handling, object-oriented programming, and basic banking logic.

Key Features:
1. Create new bank accounts
2. Deposit and withdraw money
3. View account information
4. Simple, interactive command-line interface
5. Stores account data in local files (accounts.data)

How to Run:
In the terminal: python main.py

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. Run the above command from the project directory in the terminal.

Note:
This project is designed to be executed only in the terminal and does not include a graphical user interface (GUI).
